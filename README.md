## Introduction

### Description and Background
Guadalajara is a metropolis in Western Mexico and the capital of the state of Jalisco. The metropolitan area of Guadalajara is the second largest of the country and is an international center of business, finance, arts and culture as well as the economic center of the Baj√≠o region, one of the most productive and developed regions in Latin America.

For this project, we will take the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, which includes Zapopan, Guadalajara, Tlajomulco, Tlaquepaque and Tonala as boroughs/counties and try to find the best neighborhood to open a Gymnastics Business based on the USA Gymnastics recommendations for opening on of these type of facilities.

To do this, we will cluster the neighborhoods based on their nearby venues (using Foursquare API) after segmenting them by their spending capacity (based on the Housing Sales Prices). Thus, this project may also result useful to anyone looking to open a business in the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, as it provides a clustered list of the wealthiest neighborhoods.

This project is targeted towards:
  * Anyone trying to open a Gymnastics Business or similar venues (arts or sports school)
  * People interested on the distribution of the main venues on each of the neighborhoods in Guadalajara, Jalisco.

### Data Description
For the project we used the following data:
  * An Excel file provided by the Geographical and Statistical Information Institute of Jalisco (IIEG) that contained a list of 17,700 prices of houses on the different neighborhoods in the metropolitan area. NOTE: This database was built on April 2020, so we used the exchange rate from the end of that month (24.207 MXN/USD).
  * From the previous excel database we took only the 150 wealthiest neighborhoods for the project and then dropped those that were too far from the city
  * Foursquare API to get the most common venues for each of the selected neighborhoods.
  * The geopy.geocoders library to get the coordinates for each neighborhood in order to map it using the folium library, the coordinates were also used for the Foursquare API.
  * Lastly, a USA Gymnastics guide mentioning the factors to consider when choosing a location for a Gymnastics facility.
