## Introduction

### Description and Background
Guadalajara is a metropolis in Western Mexico and the capital of the state of Jalisco. The metropolitan area of Guadalajara is the second largest of the country and is an international center of business, finance, arts and culture as well as the economic center of the Baj√≠o region, one of the most productive and developed regions in Latin America.

For this project, the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, which includes Zapopan, Guadalajara, Tlajomulco, Tlaquepaque and Tonala as boroughs was studied. The objective was to find the best location to open a Gymnastics Academy based on the USA Gymnastics guide for opening one of these facilities, which considers the surrounding neighborhood's spending capacity, nearby venues, competition, etc.

### Data Description and Methodology

 * A database provided by the Geographical and Statistical Information Institute of Jalisco (IIEG), which contains the sales prices for 17,700 houses on the different neighborhoods of the metropolitan area of Guadalajara, was used to categorize each neighborhood based on its average sales price. The resulting database allowed us to work with only the wealthiest neighborhoods in the city.
 * Geopy and Folium libraries was used to get the coordinates for each neighborhood and create interactive maps respectively.
 * Foursquare API allowed us to retrieve the nearby venues for each neighborhood, as well as retrieving and evaluating the potential competitors.

### Target Audience
This project may result interesting to anyone attempting to start a business in Guadalajara, Mexico or to someone just interested on how the different venues are distributed around one of the biggest and most important cities of Latin America.
